Minicraft+ was started to expand upon the Minicraft game from 2011. Over the years we have added a lot of new stuff, and gone through many developers.
Our goal is to expand Minicraft to be more fun and continuous.

Minicraft was originally made by Markus Persson for the ludum dare 22 competition.

Minicraft Red is a mod created by Itayfeder, which aims to add new content and features to the game.
